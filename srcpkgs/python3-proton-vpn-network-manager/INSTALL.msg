You should install one of the following tools, depending on your desktop environment:

  - network-manager-applet : Recommended for GNOME and GTK-based environments
  - plasma-nm      				 : Recommended for KDE Plasma

Only one is needed. Without it, you may not be prompted to enter your VPN credentials, and connections requiring authentication could fail.
